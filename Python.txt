  1.  Scripting language is interpreted. The advantages: rapid development(no compliation requirment); Portable(cross platform, no machine code, are good to control other applications); but slower than compliered language. Scripting languages are flexible(Vast modules, packages and extensions avalible). Scripting languages can be used for system administration, web development(server side, client side), text processing/manipulation, gluing programs and tool, job control and automaion and GUI.
2.  The interpreter is a program that executes scripts without first compiling them into machine code per statement(Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL)).
  1)  parse the sourcecode and perform its behavior directly
  2)  translate sourcecode into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute it
3.  Examples of scripting languages are 
  • Shell(manyvariants),PowerShell
  • sed, awk ( Text processing)
  • Python,Perl,PHP
  • Ruby
  • Visual Basic ( VB A, VBScript, VB. NE T)
  • Javascript
  • Lua,R,...
4.  Scripting languages provide an even higher- level of abstraction than java and C.
  • The main goal is programming productivity, performance is a secondary consideration
  • Provide primitive operations with greater functionality
Initial scripting languages were for job control
  • 1960s,IBMSystem 360JCL(job control language)
  • Used to launch compilation,execution,and to check return codes
5.   Scripting languages are as gluing languages. 
  • Often used to combine components
  • they assume a collection of useful components already exist in other languages
  • e.g., Unix shell scripts assemble filter programs into pipelines
  • ls–l|wc-l
  • e.g.,interface between database and Webserver
  Thus often called glue languages or system integration languages
