Pandas
1.Pandas deals with the following three data structures âˆ’
  Series: 1D labeled homogeneous array, sizeimmutable.
  DataFrame: General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously typed columns.
  Panel: General 3D labeled, size-mutable array.
  These data structures are built on top of Numpy array, which means they are fast.
